# ADP
This is an initial redesign to move ADP away from their Wordpress format.

## Features
- No editable features required
- No backend editor needed for continued maintenance/
- Stand-alone design - Acting as a info/splash page
- No Async requests needed for early stage
- Google Analytics integration needed
- Logo Redesign

## Planning
- Originally I wanted to implement Redux to structure this application, but chose otherwise as the project was primarily a visual redesign with very little user input.
- React will be used for the visual components.

## Dependencies
- `react`
- `sass`
